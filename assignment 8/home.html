            <em>Delhi, India</em>
            <!-- news details -->
            <p>An uneasy calm has settled over Delhi after three days of riots, with the death toll from the unrest rising to 27 on Wednesday. More than 200 people have been injured by rocks, bullets, beatings, stabbings, and even acid burns. The clashes between Hindus and Muslims began amid protests over India’s new controversial citizenship law passed in December, which eases the pathway to citizenship for some immigrants from neighboring countries but excludes Muslims.

Although India’s national security advisor has said the situation is “under control,” the religious violence has been the worst in the capital in decades, the Guardian reports. Mobs have chanted pro-Hindu slogans and burned or vandalized mosques, shops, and other Muslim properties. Police and paramilitary forces have been deployed in the hardest-hit areas of the city, where many Muslims have now abandoned their homes. Sporadic violence continued on Thursday.

          <p>In a new blog post, Google has confirmed three “High” level vulnerabilities within Chrome 80, one of which (CVE-2020-6418) is passwords stored locally inside Chrome's internal SQLite database. This severely impacts the ability of hackers to extract passwords from the browser and ZDNet reports that black markets are already running out of hacked data to sell as a result.a zero-day exploit that “exists in the wild”. This makes sticking on the current version of Chrome an immediate danger. Neowin notes that the zero day exploit is a Type Confusion hack which exploits JavaScript and deliberately causes errors in the browser through which hackers can run unrestricted code.
